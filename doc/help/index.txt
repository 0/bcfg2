Getting Help with Bcfg2
=======================

Having trouble? We'd like to help!

There are several ways to get in touch with the Bcfg2 community.

* Try the :ref:`FAQ <faq-index>` -- it's got answers to many common
  questions.
* Check the :ref:`help-troubleshooting` page to see if you can narrow
  down the cause of your issue.
* Looking for specific information? Try the :ref:`genindex`,
  :ref:`modindex`, or the :ref:`detailed table of contents <contents>`.
* Search for information in the :ref:`help-mailinglist`.
* Visit our :ref:`help-irc`, or search the `IRC logs`_.

Note that the IRC channel tends to be much busier than the mailing
list; use whichever seems most appropriate for your query, but don't
let the lack of mailing list activity make you think the project isn't
active.
