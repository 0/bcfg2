FAQ: Client
===========

**No ca is specified. Cannot authenticate the server with SSL.**

This means that the client does not have a copy of the CA for the server,
so it can't verify that it is talking to the right server. To fix this
issue, copy ``/etc/bcfg2.crt`` from the server to ``/etc/bcfg2.ca``
on the client. Then add the following on the client.::

    [communication]
    ca = /etc/bcfg2.ca

**Server failure**

On Fedora 14 and above it can happen that no connection is possible.

    # bcfg2 -vqne
    Server failure: Protocol Error: 401 Unauthorized
    Failed to download probes from bcfg2
    Server Failure
