    structure

    repository
        A collection of folders and files that make up the configurations
        that Bcfg2 applies to server. The repository is located at
        ``/var/lib/bcfg2`` by default. This is not to be confused with
        a :term:VCS repository, which is an excellent place to pull
        your Bcfg2 repository from to manage changes. When used alone,
        repository refers to a Bcfg2 repository.

    VCS
        Stands for `Version Control System
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control>`_.
