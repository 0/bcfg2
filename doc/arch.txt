The BCFG2 Architecture consists of four main parts:

The core is the component containing shared data:
 - file alteration monitor
 - metadata store
 - generators
 - structuring agents
 - change notification mechanism

Generators: configuration atom construction mechanism
 - configuration repository
 - package management
 - service management
 - ssh key management
 - hostbase

Structuring Agents - code that forms the configuration into
      independant and dependant clauses
 - Bundler
 - Translator
 - Literal
 - Image data

Client - state transition engine that runs on clients.
