This document describes how to setup a Bcfg2 repository from scratch. 

1. /etc/bcfg2.conf

This file tells Bcfg2Server important bootstrapping information about
where its repository is, and which configuration structuring agents
and generators should be used to build client
configurations. The list of structures and generators are comma
delimited and must be importable by python from the
Bcfg2.Server.(Generators|Structures) hierarchy (respectively). All
options currently are in the [server] section. 

repository: top level of configuration file repository
structures: comma delimited list of structuring agents to use. 
generators: comma delimited list of generators to use. 
metadata: path to the directory where metadata.xml (the client
                 metadata setup) resides. 

2. metadata/metadata.xml

This file defines metadata constructs for all known systems. This file
contains two types of declarations: one for clients, including an
attribute for client image, and client nodes for class membership and
attributes.  See the example file for more info. This file doesn't
need to be exhaustively written: bcfg2 will soon support defaults (to
support environments where machines are frequently added) and default
profiles. 

3. The repository

Structuring agents and generators are responsible for contructing
client configurations. All of these currently use FAM to coherently
cache files on disk, with notifications upon file changes. The
repository contains a directory for each of these; which is structured
according to the needs of that generator/structure.
