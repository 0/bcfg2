The quick guide to installng bcfg2

Bcfg2 is written in python. Hence a few of python modules 
are required.

1. Install prerequisites
   - ssslib: a component messaging library.
       ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/sss
   - python-fam
       http://python-fam.sourceforge.net
   - element tree
       http://www.effbot.org
   - xerces (optional; needed to validate the configuration repository)

2. Do not enable sss services included with ssslib; instead, setup a static
    entry in /etc/sss.conf for the bcfg2 server. The service name is bcfg2, and
    the port can be arbitrary. This will remove the need for an active service
    directory running on your system. Note that /etc/sss.conf will be needed in order
    to bootstrap new nodes, and should be controlled by bcfg2 so that updates
    can be made.

3. Setup bcfg2.conf. You need to pick which generators and structures are used, and
    configure them properly. (This topic is discussed elsewhere)

4. Fire up the daemon. 

5. Run the client.
