FAQ: General
============

**What does Bcfg2 stand for?**

Initially, Bcfg stood for the bundle configuration system. Bcfg2 is the
second major revision. At this point, the acronym is meaningless, but
the name has stuck. Luckily, Bcfg2 googles better than Bcfg does. No,
seriously. Try it. All I know is that I have no interest in a billion
cubic feet of gas.

**What architectures does Bcfg2 support?**

Bcfg2 should run on any POSIX compatible operating system, however direct
support for an operating system's package and service formats are limited
by the currently available :ref:`client-tools-index` (although new client
tools are pretty easy to add). The following is an incomplete but more
exact list of platforms on which Bcfg2 works.

* GNU/Linux deb based distros
* GNU/Linux rpm based distros
* Solaris pkg based
* Gentoo portage based
* OSX (POSIX/launchd support)

**What pre-requisites are needed to run Bcfg2?**

Please visit the :ref:`prerequisites` section in the manual.

**Why won't bcfg2-server start?**

If your server doesn't seem to be starting and you see no error
messages in your server logs, try running it in the foreground to
see why.

**Why am I getting a traceback?**

If you get a traceback, please let us know. You can file a 
`ticket <https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/newticket>`_, send
the traceback to the :ref:`mailinglist`, or hop on 
:ref:`ircchannel` and let us know. 

**What is the most common cause of "The following entries are not handled by any tool"?**

Often it corresponds to entries that aren't bound by the server (for which you'll get error messages on the server). You should try inspecting the logs on the server to see what may be the cause.

**How can I figure out if error is client or server side?**

* Cache a copy of the client using ``bcfg2 -c /tmp/config.xml``
* Search for the entry of interest
* If it looks correct, then there is a client issue 

This file contains all aspects of client configuration. It is structured as a series of bundles and base entries.

.. note::

    Most often the entry is not correct and the issue lies in the specification.

**Where are the server log messages?**

The bcfg2-server process logs to syslog facility LOG_DAEMON. The server produces a series of messages upon a variety of events and errors.

**Is there a way to check if all repository XML files conform to schemas?**

Bcfg2 comes with XML schemas describing all of the XML formats used in
the server repository. A validation command ``bcfg2-repo-validate`` is
included with the source distribution and all packages. Run it with
the ``-v`` flag to see each file and the results if its validation.
