Getting Help
============

Having trouble? We'd like to help!

There are several ways to get in touch with the community around Bcfg2.

* Try the :ref:`FAQ <faq-index>` -- it's got answers to many common
  questions.

* Looking for specific information? Try the :ref:`genindex`, 
  :ref:`modindex`, or the :ref:`detailed table of contents <contents>`.

* Search for information in the :ref:`mailinglist`.

* Ask a question in the :ref:`ircchannel`, or search the `IRC logs`_ 
  to see if its been asked before.

Note that the IRC channel tends to be much busier than the mailing
list; use whichever seems most appropriate for your query, but don't
let the lack of mailing list activity make you think the project isn't
active.
