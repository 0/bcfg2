Create, delete, list, or modify client entries. ::

    bcfg2-admin client add <client> attr1=val1 attr2=val2

Allowed attributes are *profile*, *uuid*, *password*, *location*, *secure*, 
and *address*.

A full example is shown below:: 

    bcfg2-admin client add laptop02.example.com profile="basic"

For more details please refer to the
:ref:`Metadata section <server-plugins-grouping-metadata>`.

With ``list`` the file ``clients.xml`` is parsed and all entries are shown::

    bcfg2-admin client list
    server01.example.com
    laptop02.example.com

This is useful for a quick check after adding an entry.  If you want more
in-depth information about a client, ``bcfg2-client clients`` can provide
that.  Please refer to the :ref:`bcfg2-info <guide-server-bcfg2_info>` 
section for further details.
