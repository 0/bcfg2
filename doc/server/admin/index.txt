The ``bcfg2-admin`` command provides you an interface which allows you
to interact with your Bcfg2 repository in an administrative fashion. To
get started, run ``bcfg2-admin help``. You will be presented with a list
of different *modes* which each provide various administrative
functionality. Available modes are listed below.

directly in your Bcfg2 repository (e.g. /var/lib/bcfg2)::

    bcfg2-admin backup

client

Create, delete, or modify client entries.::

    bcfg2-admin client add

specification instances.
