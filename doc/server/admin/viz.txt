Produce graphviz diagrams of metadata structures.

The following command will produce a graphviz image which includes hosts,
bundles, and a key::

    bcfg2-admin viz -H -b -k -o ~/bcfg2.png

.. note:: The graphviz package available via DAG/RPMforge has been known
          to have dependency issues. We recommend installing the package
          from EPEL.
