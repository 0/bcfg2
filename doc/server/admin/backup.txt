.. _Samples repository: https://github.com/solj/bcfg2-repo

Create an archive of the whole Bcfg2 :term:`repository`. The archive is stored
directly in your Bcfg2 repository (e.g. ``/var/lib/bcfg2/``) and named with 
the current data and time::

    bcfg2-admin backup

A backup is recommanded before you start using the `Samples repository`_ of
Bcfg2.
