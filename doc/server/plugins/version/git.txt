Git
===

The Git plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to your
bcfg2 repository using a `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ backend. It
enables you to get revision information out of your repository for
reporting purposes. Once the plugin is enabled, every time a client
checks in, it will include the current repository revision in the
reports/statistics.

If the ``dulwich`` library is installed, the Git plugin will use
that.  If ``dulwich`` is not installed, but ``GitPython`` is, that
will be used instead.  If neither is installed, then calls will be
made to the git command.

If you plan to edit your git repository in-place on the Bcfg2 server
(which is probably not recommended), then you may want to avoid using
``dulwich``; it's sufficiently low-level that it may not present a
user-friendly git repository at all times.

Additionally, the Git plugin exposes one XML-RPC method calls,
``Git.Update``, which updates the working copy to the latest version
in the remote origin.

Enabling the Git plugin
=======================

To enable the Git plugin, simply add it to your plugins line in
``/etc/bcfg2.conf``::

    [server]
    plugins = Bundler,Cfg,Metadata,...,Git
