Git
===

The Git plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to your
bcfg2 repository using a `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ backend. It
enables you to get revision information out of your repository for
reporting purposes. Once the plugin is enabled, every time a client
checks in, it will include the current repository revision in the
reports/statistics.

As with the other Version plugins, the Git plugin enables you to get
revision information out of your repository for reporting
purposes. Once the plugin is enabled, every time a client checks in,
it will include the current repository revision in the
reports/statistics.

Additionally, if the ``GitPython`` library is installed, the Git
plugin exposes an additional XML-RPC method call, ``Git.Update``,
which updates the working copy to the latest version in the remote
origin.

Enabling the Git plugin
=======================

To enable the Git plugin, simply add it to your plugins line in
``/etc/bcfg2.conf``::

    [server]
    plugins = Bundler,Cfg,Metadata,...,Git
