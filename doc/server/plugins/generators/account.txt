Account
=======

The account plugin manages authentication data, including

* /etc/passwd
* /etc/group
* /etc/security/limits.conf
* /etc/sudoers
* /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

User access data is stored in three files in the Account directory:

* superusers (a list of users who always have root privs)
* rootlist (a list of user:host pairs for scoped root privs)
* useraccess (a list of user:host pairs for login access)

SSH keys are stored in files named $username.key; these are installed
into root's authorized keys for users in the superusers list as well as
for the pertitent users in the rootlike file (for the current system).

Authentication data is read in from (static|dyn).(passwd|group) The static
ones are for system local ones, while the dyn. versions are for external
synchronization (from ldap/nis/etc). There is also a static.limits.conf
that provides the limits.conf header and any static entries.
