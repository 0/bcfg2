SSLCA
=====

SSLCA is a simple generator plugin designed to handle creation of
SSL private keys and certificates on request.

At present, only the following file locations are supported, and thus
only a single key and certifcate will be generated:

* /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
* /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt

While this could be seen as very limiting, SSLCA does support any aliases
specified in clients.xml. Any aliases will be added to the cert under the
subjectAltName extension.


Interacting with SSLCA
======================

* Pre-seeding with existing keys/certs -- Currently existing keys/certs
  will be overwritten by new, sslca-managed ones by default. Pre-existing
  files can be added to the repository by putting them in
  <repo>/SSLCA/<filename>.H_<hostname>

* Revoking existing keys -- deleting <repo>/SSLCA/\*.H_<hostname>
  will remove files for an existing client.


Getting started
===============

#. Add SSLCA to the **plugins** line in ``/etc/bcfg2.conf`` and
   restart the server -- This enables the SSLCA plugin on the Bcfg2
   server.

#. Add Path entries for ``/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key``, and
   ``/etc/pky/tls/certs/localhost.crt``, etc to a bundle or base.

#. Add a [sslca] section to ``/etc/bcfg2.conf`` contaning the following
   information:

   ca_cert - location of the CA certificate
   ca_key - CA private key
   ca_key_passphrase - Passphrase (if any) needed to use the CA private key
   cert_subject - Additional subject info for the resulting certificates, CN
                  will always be the bcfg2 clients hostname.
   cert_days - number of days from generation that cert should be valid.
   pkey_bits - number of bits for the private key.

#. Enjoy.
