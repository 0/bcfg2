As submitted by Kamil Kisiel

The following is my ``/etc/cron.d/bcfg2`` file. It uses the python random
module seeded with the client hostname to generate a random time for the
client to check in. The hostname seed ensures the generated file is the
same each time the client checks in. This cron file helps to distribute
the load on the Bcfg2 server since not all machines are checking in at
the same time.::

    {% python
    from genshi.builder import tag
    import random
    random.seed(metadata.hostname)
    %}\
    ${random.randint(0,60)} * * * *    root    /usr/sbin/bcfg2 &> /dev/null

You can apply the same concept to the other time fields by adding another
``${random.randint()}`` call.
