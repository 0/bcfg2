serial-console-speed
====================

A probe to tell us what the serial console speed should be for a given
piece of hardware. This pre-supposed some knowledge of the hardware
because you define the speeds in here instead of attempting to probe
bios or something in the hardware in most cases (like x86).

.. code-block:: sh

    #!/bin/sh
    #
    #
    # figure out what serial speed we should tell bcfg2 to use.
    # since there's no way to probe, we need to set this up by external
    # knowledge of the system hardware type (and just make sure we
    # standardize on that serial speed for that hardware class)

    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin; export PATH
    # let's figure out what product type this is
    os=`uname -s`
    productname="product-no-dmidecode"

    if [ $os = "Linux" ] ; then
        productname=`dmidecode -s system-product-name 2>&1`
        case $productname in
        "PowerEdge M600")
            echo "115200"
            ;;
        *)
            echo "9600"
            ;;
        esac
    fi
    if [ $os = "SunOS" ]; then
        platform=`uname -i`
        case $platform in
        SUNW,*)
    	eeprom ttya-mode | sed 's/ttya-mode=//'|awk -F, '{print $1}'
    	;;
        *)
    	echo "9600"
    	;;
