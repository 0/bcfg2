OS X
====

Once macports is installed::

    port install bcfg2

Using native OS X python
------------------------

First, make sure you have Xcode installed as you need `packagemaker` which 
comes bundled in the Developer tools.

Clone the git source::

    git clone git://git.mcs.anl.gov/bcfg2.git

Change to the osx directory and type make. Your new package should be located 
at bcfg2-'''$VERSION'''.pkg (where '''$VERSION''' is that which is specified
in setup.py).
