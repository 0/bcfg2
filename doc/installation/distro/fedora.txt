Fedora
======

The fastest way to get Bcfg2 Packages_ onto your Fedora_ system is to
use `yum` or PackageKit. Yum will pull in all dependencies of Bcfg2
automatically. ::

    $ su -c 'yum install bcfg2-server bcfg2'

Be aware that the latest release of Bcfg2 may only be available for the
Development release of Fedora (Rawhide).  With the activation of the
Rawhide repository of Fedora you will be able to install it. ::

    $ su -c 'yum install --enablerepo=rawhide bcfg2-server bcfg2'

This way is not recommanded on productive systems. Only for testing.
