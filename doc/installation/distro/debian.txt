Debian
======

Packages of Bcfg2 are available for Debian Lenny, Debian Squeeze, and
Debian Sid. The fastest way to get Bcfg2 onto your Debian system
is to use `apt-get` or `aptitude`. :: 

   sudo aptitude install bcfg2 bcfg2-server

If you want to use unofficial packages from Bcfg2. Add the following line
to your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file :: 

   deb ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/bcfg/debian sarge/

Now just run `aptitute` in the way it is mentioned above. 

For more details about running prerelease version of Bcfg2 on Debian
systems, please refer to the Wiki_.
