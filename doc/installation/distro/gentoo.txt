Gentoo
======

Early in July 2008, Bcfg2 was added to the Gentoo portage tree. So far
it's only keyworded for ~x86, but we hope to see it soon in the amd64 and
x64-solaris ports.  If you're using Gentoo on some other architecture, it
should still work provided that you have a reasonably up to date Python;
try adding `app-admin/bcfg2 ~*` to your `/etc/portage/package.keywords`
file.

If you don’t use portage to install Bcfg2, you’ll want to make sure you
have all the prerequisites installed first. For a server, you’ll need:

* ``app-admin/gamin`` or ``app-admin/fam``
* ``dev-python/lxml``

Clients will need at least:

* ``app-portage/gentoolkit``
