=======================
Version control systems
=======================

The sections in this guide do only cover the basics steps in the setup
of the different version control system for the usage with the Bcfg2
plugin support.  More more details about 

Git
===

.. _Git tutorial: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html

Adding the :ref:`server-plugins-version-git` plugins can preserve
versioning information. The first step is to add **Git** to your 
plugin line::

    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,...,Git

For tracking the configuration files in the ``/var/lib/bcfg2`` 
directory a git repository need to be established::

    git init

For more detail about the setup of git please refer to a `git tutorial`_.
The first commit can be the empty or the already populated directory::

    git add . && git commit -a

While running ``bcfg2-info`` the following line will show up::

   Initialized git plugin with git directory = /var/lib/bcfg2/.git

Mercurial 
=========

For the :ref:`server-plugins-version-hg` plugin are the same changes 
needed as for git. ::

    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,...,Mercurial

The repository must be initialized::

    hg init

Mercurial will not commit the files to the repository until a user name
is defined in ``/var/lib/bcfg2/.hg/``

.. code-block:: sh

    cat <<END_ENTRY >> /var/lib/bcfg2/.hg/hgrc
    [ui]
    username = Yor name <you@example.com>
    END_ENTRY

Now you are able to make submissions to the repository::

    hg commit

While running ``bcfg2-info`` the following line will show up::

   Initialized hg plugin with hg directory = /var/lib/bcfg2/.hg

Darcs 
=====

If you wish to use the :ref:`server-plugins-version-darcs` plugin an
entry has to be made in the ``bcfg2.conf`` file.::

    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,...,Darcs

The dracs repository must be initialized::

    darcs initialize

To commit to the darcs repository an author must be added to the 
``_darcs/prefs/author`` file.  If the ``author`` file is missing, 
darcs will ask you to enter your e-mail address.

.. code-block:: sh

    cat <<END_ENTRY >> /var/lib/bcfg2/_darcs/prefs/author
    you@example.com
    END_ENTRY

All files in the ``/var/lib/bcfg2`` should be added to darcs now::

    darcs add *

After that you can submit them to the repository::

    darcs record

While running ``bcfg2-info`` the following line will show up::

   Initialized Darcs plugin with darcs directory = /var/lib/bcfg2/_darcs

Cvs
===

If you wish to use the :ref:`server-plugins-version-darcs` plugin an
entry has to be made in the ``bcfg2.conf`` file.::

    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,...,Cvs

The CVS repository must be initialized::

    cvs -d /var/lib/bcfg2 init
