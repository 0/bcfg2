Why use the Svn plugin
======================

The Svn plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to your bcfg2 repository using a `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`_ backend. It deprecates the previous Subversion integration mentioned here at ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/bcfg/papers/directing-change-with-bcfg2.pdf. Currently, It enables you to get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes. Future plans are to commit changes to the repo which are made by the server.

How to enable the Svn plugin
============================

Simply add Svn to your plugins line in /etc/bcfg2.conf::

    [server]
    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,DBStats,Decisions,Metadata,NagiosGen,Pkgmgr,Probes,Rules,SSHbase,TGenshi,Svn
