\section{Overview}
The client model in BCFG2 remains much the same as the client model in
BCFG1. This assumptions in place are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{BCFG is the source of all client configuration.}
\item{Skew from the configuration determined by BCFG is defined to be
    incorrect.} 
\item{Local state isn't trusted. All client metadata is determined on
    the server side.}
\end{itemize}

The client configuration consists of a complete software inventory,
extra filesystem modifications, and configuration file changes. The
client configuration will be augmented in BCFG2 to also include state
information about process profiles and normal usage.
