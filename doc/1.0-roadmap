This document details the major work needed before Bcfg2 is ready for
a 1.0 release. The high-level goal for 1.0 is to fix long-standing
architecture warts and provide a reasonable internal API for the
server. 

* Major Goals
** Done
*** Build a comprehensive server plugin architecture 
*** make out of tree plugins work 
*** properties switch to connector plugin
*** Version Control Backend
*** Change to mode attribute for services
** Left
*** Fix the POSIX path problem
*** Clean up client/server statistics data format
*** Multithreaded server (sync from Cobalt)
*** Reporting System and Database
*** add support for pre/post connectors
**** Schema fixes
**** Performance 
* Other Goals
** ticket triage
** bind failure annotations
** plugin self-bootstrap (get out of bcfg2-admin init)
** core plugin filtering (for bcfg2-admin & co)
*** Document

* Pie in the sky
** Rework XMLRPC interfaces

* User visible changes
** Properties
*** switched over to a connector interface
*** now supports multiple file of XML
*** data available as metadata.Properties[filename]
** Probes
*** switched over to a connector interface
*** data available as metadata.Probes
** Service changes
*** Add overall client service mode
**** default (perform all service manipulations)
**** disabled (perform no service manipulations)
**** build (attempt to stop all services started) (deprecates/replaces -B)
*** Add per service mode
**** mode='manual' (do not start/stop/restart this service)
**** mode='default' (perform appropriate service ops)
**** mode='supervised' (default + ensure service is running when verification is performed)
     (deprecates supervised='true')
**** mode='custom' (set non-default restart target in conjunction with target attr)
** Version Control backend
*** Now implemented as plugins (Git, Svn)
*** Enable either Git or Svn plugin in the plugins line of /etc/bcfg2.conf
*** the svn option in /etc/bcfg2.conf is no longer respected
