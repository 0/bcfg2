This document details the major work needed before Bcfg2 is ready for
a 1.0 release. The high-level goal for 1.0 is to fix long-standing
architecture warts and provide a reasonable internal API for the
server. 

* Goals for 1.0
** Fix the POSIX path problem
** Build a comprehensive server plugin architecture
*** see plugin-roles for details and implementation status
** Version Control Backend
** Clean up client/server statistics data format
** Multithreaded server (sync from Cobalt)
