Documentation
=============

There are two parts of documentation in the Bcfg2 project:

* The wiki
* The manual


The wiki
--------
.. _Wiki: http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/wiki
.. _Trac: http://trac.edgewall.org/
.. _OpenID: https://openid.org/
.. _MCS: http://www.mcs.anl.gov/
.. _Argonne National Laboratory: http://www.anl.gov/

A python-based Trac_ instance is used for the Bcfg2 website. The
Wiki_ part of the website can be edited after you have successful
logged in. For the login is a vaild OpenID provider needed and an 
interaction from an administrator. Please request your access to
the Wiki_ on the :ref:`mailinglist` or in the :ref:`ircchannel`.  


The manual
----------
.. _rst: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org
.. _Docutils: 

The source for the manual is located in the `doc/` directory in the
SVN repository or in the source tarball. All files are written in 
rst_ (ReStructuredText).  For the build process we are using Sphinx_.

Building the Manual
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Install the prerequisites.  Docutils_ and Sphinx_ are needed to build.

 * For Debian (Lenny) the tools are available in the `backports <http://www.backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=instructionst>`_ repository; installation can be done with the following::
   
    apt-get -t lenny-backports install python-sphinx

 * The needed tools for Fedora based systems are in the `Fedora Package Collection <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb>`_; installation can be done easily with Yum::

    yum -y install python-sphinx python-docutils

 * Additionally, to build the PDF version:

  * LaTeX
  * pdftex

* Download the source. Please refer to :ref:`source` for more details.

* Building the HTML version, run the following command in the `doc/` directory. The output will appear in `../build/sphinx/html`::

    python setup.py build_sphinx

* Building the PDF version ::
  
   python setup.py build_sphinx --builder=latex 
   cd build/sphinx/latex
   make
