Bcfg2 Development
=================

There are several ways users can contribute to the Bcfg2 project.

* Developing code
* Testing prereleases
* Reporting bugs
* Adding to the common repository
* Improving the wiki and writing documentation


This section will outline some things that can help you get familiar
with the various areas of the Bcfg2 code.

Send patches to the :ref:`mailinglist` or create a trac 
`ticket <https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/newticket>`_
with the patch included. In order to submit a ticket via the
trac system, you will need to create a session by clicking on the
`Preferences <https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/prefs>`_ link and
filling out/saving changes to the form. In order to be considered for
mainline inclusion, patches need to be BSD licensed. The most convenient
way to prepare patches is by using ``git diff`` inside of a source tree
checked out of git.

The source tree can be checked out by running::

    git clone git://git.mcs.anl.gov/bcfg2.git

Users wishing to contribute on a regular basis can apply for direct
git access. Mail the :ref:`mailinglist` for details.
