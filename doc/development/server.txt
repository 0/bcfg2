Writing Server Plugins
----------------------

Metadata
^^^^^^^^

If you would like to define your own Metadata plugin (to extend/change
functionality of the existing Metadata plugin), here are the steps to
do so. We will call our new plugin `MyMetadata`.

#. Add MyMetadata.py

   .. code-block:: python

       __revision__ = '$Revision$'

       import Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Metadata

       class MyMetadata(Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Metadata.Metadata):
           '''This class contains data for bcfg2 server metadata'''
           __version__ = '$Id$'
           __author__ = 'bcfg-dev@mcs.anl.gov'

       def __init__(self, core, datastore, watch_clients=True):
           Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Metadata.Metadata.__init__(self, core, datastore, watch_clients)

#. Add MyMetadata to ``src/lib/Server/Plugins/__init__.py``
#. Replace Metadata with MyMetadata in the plugins line of bcfg2.conf

Packages
--------

In order to support a given client package tool driver, that driver
must support use of the auto value for the version attribute in Package
entries. In this case, the tool driver views the current state of
available packages, and uses the underlying package manager's choice of
correct package version in lieu of an explicit, centrally-specified,
version. This support enables Packages to provide a list of Package
entries with version='auto'. Currently, the APT and YUMng drivers support
this feature. Note that package management systems without any network
support cannot operate in this fashion, so RPMng and SYSV will never be
able to use Packages. Emerge, Zypper, IPS, and Blastwave all have the
needed features to be supported by Packages, but support has not yet
been written.

Packages fills two major functions in configuration generation. The first
is to provide entry level binding support for Package entries included
in client configurations. This function is quite easy to implement;
Packages determines (based on client group membership) if the package
is available for the client system, and which type it has. Because
version='auto' is used, no version determination needs to be done.

The second major function is more complex. Packages ensures that client
configurations include all package-level prerequisites for package entries
explicitly included in the configuration. In order to support this,
Packages needs to directly process network data for package management
systems (the network sources for apt or yum, for examples), process
these files, and build data structures describing prerequisites and the
providers of those functions/paths. To simplify implementations of this,
there is a generic base class (Bcfg2.Server.Plugins.Packages.Source)
that provides a framework for fetching network data via HTTP, processing
those sources (with subclass defined methods for processing the specific
format provided by the tool), a generic dependency resolution method,
and a caching mechanism that greatly speeds up server/bcfg2-info startup.

Each source type must define:

* a get_urls attribute (and associated urls property) that describes
  the URLS where to get data from.
* a read_files method that reads and processes the downloaded files

Sources may define a get_provides method, if provides are complex. For
example, provides in rpm can be either rpm names or file paths, so
multiple data sources need to be multiplexed.

The APT source in ``src/lib/Server/Plugins/Packages.py`` provides a
relatively simple implementation of a source.
