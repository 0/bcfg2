Here are a few things that users of Bcfg2 have to say about it:

* `... With so many machines and so much variation and subtleties
  between machines, I would simply go crazy trying to manage and
  maintain these machines. Bcfg makes my life much
  simpler. <http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/web-mail-archive/lists/bcfg-dev/2006/03/msg00023.html>`_
  -- Ti Leggett

* When I took over managing a compute cluster, its configuration
  management was a mess.  A liberal dose of Bcfg cleaned up the
  machines, made them more secure, and gave me the information needed
  to keep an eye on them.  I definitely trust the cluster more now
  that its configuration is well-defined and well-managed. -- Cory

* "`Bcfg2 propaganda
  <http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/unix-sysadmin/bcfg2-propaganda-29441>`_"
  - Two days ago Mathieu Jobin had sent a message to bcfg-dev mailing
  list containing a link to Yahoo!'s grid white paper mentioning
  Bcfg2. As I don't think Bcfg2 is getting as much attention as it
  should, I thought about mentioning it
  here.
