1.4.0pre1
=========

The first prerelease for Bcfg2 1.4.0 is now available at:

 ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/bcfg

Bcfg2 1.4.0pre1 is a prerelease, and contains many new features,
including some that are backwards-incompatible with Bcfg2 1.3.x and
earlier. Please read the release notes thoroughly. This is a prerelease
and as such is not likely suitable for general production deployment.
That said, please help us test the release in non- and preproduction
environments.

backwards-incompatible user-facing changes
------------------------------------------

* Completely rewrote option parser

  Many single character options now have long equivalents.  Some
  subcommand interfaces (``bcfg2-info``, ``bcfg2-admin``) have been
  reorganized to some degree. ``bcfg2-reports`` syntax is completely
  different.

* Added new ACL plugin
  (http://docs.bcfg2.org/dev/server/plugins/misc/acl.html)

  Default ACLs only allow clients to perform bcfg2 client runs, and only
  permit `bcfg2-admin xcmd` calls from localhost.  If you want to change
  this, you must enable the ACL plugin and configure your own ACLs.

* Added genshi requirement for the server

* Decisions

  * Switch plugin to use StructFile instead of host- or group-specific XML
    files (this allows a single e.g. whitelist.xml file with <Group> tags)

    You can convert your existing decisions using
    ``tools/upgrade/1.4/migrate_decisions.py``.


deprecated features (will be removed in a future release, likely 1.5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Bundler

  * Deprecated use of an explicit name attribute
  * Deprecated .genshi bundles (use .xml bundles and specify the genshi
    namespace instead)

    http://docs.bcfg2.org/dev/server/plugins/structures/bundler/index.html#genshi-templates

* SSLCA

  * Deprecated plugin
  * SSLCA functionality has been added to the Cfg plugin.
