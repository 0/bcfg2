===========================
Detailed Bcfg2 Architecture
===========================

Bcfg2 is based on a client-server architecture. The client is responsible
for interpreting (but not processing) the configuration served by the
server. This configuration is literal, so no local process is required.
After completion of the configuration process, the client uploads a set
of statistics to the server. This section will describe the goals and
then the architecture motivated by it.
