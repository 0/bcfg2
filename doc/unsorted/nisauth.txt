==================
NIS Authentication
==================

'''Edit Django settings'''

Django allows for custom authentication backends to its login procedure.  Hostbase has an NIS authentication backend that verifies a user to be in the unix group allowed to modify Hostbase.

To enable this feature:

* first edit your {{{Hostbase/settings.py}}} file and uncomment the line {{{'Hostbase.backends.NISBackend',}}} in the list of {{{AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS}}}
* enter the name of the unix group you want to give access to Hostbase in the {{{AUTHORIZED_GROUP}}} variable
* in your {{{Hostbase/hostbase/views.py}}} file at the very bottom, uncomment the block(s) of lines that give you the desired level of access

Hostbase will now direct the user to a login page if he or she is not authorized to view a certain page.  Users should log in with their regular Unix username and password.
