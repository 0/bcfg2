VCS Client Tool
===============

.. warning: This tool is currently under development.

.. note: Currently, the only supported VCS is git and svn.

The VCS tool allows you to checkout particular revisions from a VCS
repository on the client to a specified path. The tool requires the
appropriate python libraries for the VCS used to be installed.

See :ref:`server-plugins-generators-rules-vcs` for possible options.

Example usage:

You may want to create a `Rules/paths.xml` with the following:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Rules priority="1">
        <Path name="/srv/bcfg2" type="vcs"
              sourceurl="https://github.com/Bcfg2/bcfg2.git"
              vcstype="git"
              revision="cf6dfd8ca28e941b1e638ff0fa7e7a0a1ebb6a6f"/>
    </Rules>

Once the rule is created a client can reference the path from a
bundle, this path will then be populated from the repository. To
continue the above example, a file `Bundle/bcfg2.xml` might contain
this:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Bundle name="bcfg">
        <Path name="/srv/bcfg2">
    <Bundle/>
