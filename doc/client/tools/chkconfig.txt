=========
Chkconfig
=========

Tool to manage services (primarily on Red Hat based distros).

.. note:: Start and stop are standard arguments, but the one for reload
          isn't consistent across services. You can specify which argument
          to use with the `restart` property in Service tags. Example:
          ``<Service name="ftp" restart="condrestart" status="on"
          type="chkconfig">``
