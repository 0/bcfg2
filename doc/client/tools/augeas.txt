 Augeas
========

The Augeas tool provides a way to use `Augeas
<http://www.augeas.net>`_ to edit files that may not be completely
managed.

In the simplest case, you simply tell Augeas which path to edit, and
give it a sequence of commands:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Path type="augeas" name="/etc/hosts" owner="root" group="root"
          mode="0644">
      <Set path="01/ipaddr" value="192.168.0.1"/>
      <Set path="01/canonical" value="pigiron.example.com"/>
      <Set path="01/alias[1]" value="pigiron"/>
      <Set path="01/alias[2]" value="piggy"/>
    </Path>

The commands are run in document order.  There's no need to do an
explicit ``save`` at the end.

Each of these commands will only be run if the path does not already
have the given setting.  That is, the ip address for the first host
record will only be set to ``192.168.0.1`` if it's not set to that
value already.  Its canonical name will only be set to
``pigiron.example.com`` if it's not that already; and so on.

The Augeas paths are all relative to ``/files/etc/hosts``.

The Augeas tool understands a subset of ``augtool`` commands.  Valid
tags are: ``Remove``, ``Move``, ``Set``, ``Clear``, ``SetMulti``, and
``Insert``.  Refer to the official Augeas docs or the `Schema`_ below
for details on the commands.

Editing files outside the default load path
===========================================

If you're using Augeas to edit files outside of its default load path,
you must manually specify the lens.  For instance:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Path type="augeas" name="/opt/jenkins/home/config.xml" lens="Xml"
          owner="jenkins" group="jenkins" mode="0640">
      <Set path="hudson/systemMessage/#text"
           value="This is a Jenkins server."/>
    </Path>

Note that there's no need to manually modify the load path by setting
``/augeas/load/<lens>/incl``, nor do you have to call ``load``
explicitly.

Performance
===========

The Augeas tool is quite slow to initialize.  For each ``<Path
type="augeas" ... >`` entry you have, it creates a new Augeas object
internally, which can take several seconds.  It's thus important to
use this tool sparingly.
