Mac OS X Services. To use this tool, you must maintain a standard launch
daemon .plist file in ``/Library/LaunchDaemons/`` (example ssh.plist)
and setup a ``<Service name="com.openssh.sshd" type="launchd" status="on"
/>`` entry in your config to load or unload the service. Note the name
is the ''Label'' specified inside of the .plist file
