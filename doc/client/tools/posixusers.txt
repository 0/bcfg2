POSIXUsers
==========

The POSIXUsers tool handles the creation of users and groups as
defined by ``POSIXUser`` and ``POSIXGroup`` entries.  For a full
description of those tags, see :ref:`server-plugins-generators-rules`.

The POSIXUsers tool relies on the ``useradd``, ``usermod``,
``userdel``, ``groupadd``, ``groupmod``, and ``groupdel`` tools, since
there is no Python library to manage users and groups.  It expects
those tools to be in ``/usr/sbin``.

Primary group creation
======================

Each user must have a primary group, which can be specified with the
``group`` attribute of the ``POSIXUser`` tag.  (If the ``group``
attribute is not specified, then a group with the same name as the
user will be used.)  If that group does not exist, the POSIXUsers tool
will create it automatically.  It does this by adding a ``POSIXGroup``
entry on the fly; this has a few repercussions:

* When run in interactive mode (``-I``), Bcfg2 will prompt for
  installation of the group separately from the user.
* The ``POSIXGroup`` entry is added to the same bundle as the
  ``POSIXUser`` entry, so if the group is created, the bundle is
  considered to have been modified and consequently Actions will be
  run and Services will be restarted.  This should never be a concern,
  since the group can only be created, not modified (it has no
  attributes other than its name), and if the group is being created
  then the user will certainly be created or modified as well.
* The group is created with no specified GID number.  If you need to
  specify a particular GID number, you must explicitly define a
  ``POSIXGroup`` entry for the group.

Creating a baseline configuration
=================================

The majority of users on many systems are created by the packages that
are installed, but currently Bcfg2 cannot query the package database
to determine these users.  (In some cases, this is a limitation of the
packaging system.)  The often-tedious task of creating a baseline that
defines all users and groups can be simplified by use of the
``tools/posixusers_baseline.py`` script, which outputs a bundle
containing all users and groups on the machine it's run on.
