Available client tools
======================

Client tool drivers allow Bcfg2 to execute configuration operations
by interfacing with platform and distribution specific tools.

Tool drivers handle any reconfiguration or verification operation. 
So far we have tools that primarily deal with packaging systems 
and service management. The POSIX tool also handles file system 
and permissions/groups operations. To write your own tool driver, 
to handle a new packaging format, or new service architecture see 
:ref:`development-client-driver`.

When the Bcfg2 client is run, it attempts to instantiate each of 
these drivers. The succeeding list of drivers are printed as a 
debug message after this process has completed. Drivers can 
supercede one another, for example, the Yum driver conflicts (and 
unloads) the RPM driver. This behavior can be overridden by running 
the Bcfg2 client with the ``-D`` flag. This flag takes a colon 
delimited list of drivers to use on the system.

Currently these are the tool drivers that are distributed with Bcfg2:
