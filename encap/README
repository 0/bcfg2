tools-build
-----------
Tools used during the build process; should be built before anything else.
 * m4 - The macro processor, used by mkencap, which is used by everything.
 * makeself - A utility to create self-extracting archives, used by the 
              top-level Makefile to create the bcfg2-*.run distributions.
 * patch - Used to patch daemontools and ostiary sources before they build.

bcfg2-client
------------
bcfg2 gettext libgcc libiconv libstdc++ libxml2 libxslt lxml openssl pkg-config pyopenssl pyrex python zlib

bcfg2-cheetah
-------------
The cheetah python-powered templating system. Used as a build tool by bcfg2-site, and by bcfg2-server. Build order: 

bcfg2-python-apt
----------------
Needed for bcfg2 clients that use the "Advanced Packaging Tool" (apt), such as Debian and Ubuntu.

bcfg2-server
------------
Gamin (and glib, upon which it depends), which are needed by the bcfg2 server. Only for GNU/Linux.

bcfg2-site
----------
Tools to make an encap package with your site-specific bcfg2.conf,
custom bcfg2 generators, bcfg2 client run frequency, etc.

tools-deploy/daemontools
------------------------
D. J. Bernstein's daemontools - a collection of tools for managing UNIX services the same way across all UNIX platforms. Used by bcfg2-site to run ostiary and bcfg2-client; may also be used to run bcfg2-server.

tools-deploy/ostiary
--------------------
Ray Ingles' ostiary - simple, secure remote script execution. Used by bcfg2-site to enable the remote kickoff of bcfg2-client runs.

bcfg2-python-apt
----------------
Before building this, make sure that you have these libraries installed:
 * /usr/lib/libapt-pkg* (Part of the "apt" package on Debian)
 * /usr/lib/libapt-inst* (Part of the "apt-utils" package on Debian)

You also must have the "libapt-pkg-dev" package installed.

To see if your Debian variant is supported, do "grep ifeq Makefile" and see if
any of those strings match "cat /etc/issue".

It should be pretty trivial to add new Debian platforms; if you have any
issues, mail the bcfg2-dev list or open a ticket.
