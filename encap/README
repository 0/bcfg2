= Encap based bootstrap for bcfg2 and complete bcfg2 client toolchain =

The bcfg2-encap-bootstrap package is a method for getting bcfg2 (as a 
client), including all dependencies, up and running on a new platform as
quickly as possible (from source).

You can view this document with glorious Trac Wiki formatting at:
 * http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/wiki/EncapHowto
(Although that version may be out of date)

You can obtain the latest version of the code from bcfg2 svn:
 * `svn co https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/bcfg/trunk/bcfg2/encap`

Or browse the latest version on the web via:
 * http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/browser/trunk/bcfg2/encap

Using the encap package manager it automatically downloads, builds and
creates encap packages for bcfg2 and dependencies to `/usr/local/encap`, and
installs symbolic links to these packages from `/usr/local` (the usual encap
thing). 

It attempts to be as self contained as possible; everything gets linked to
under `/usr/local/lib/bcfg2`, except for bcfg2 itself and some dependent
software, which is prefixed by `b2` (`b2openssl`, `b2python` etc.).  

Note that to run the bcfg2 server, you also need to install gamin, which
supports a subset of the platforms bcfg2 client will work on, including
GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.

== Building and installing everything ==
 1. Make sure all of the Prerequisites (see below) are installed.
 1. The build user needs write access to the encap source and build 
    directories. By default, these are `/usr/local/encap` and 
    `/usr/local/src`. If you like to live dangerously, you can also just do 
    the builds as `root`.
 1. Run `make`. This will kick off and background the entire build process. 
    Make output will be redirected to `make.log`, and package build output 
    will go to individual log files.
 1. If everything goes well, try running "`bcfg2-repo-validate`". This should 
    not generate a python traceback :-)
 1. You now have *-encap-*.tar.gz encap packages you can distribute to other 
    machines. If you don't like the OS name encap uses automatically (esp. 
    on GNU/Linux these can be too generic), do `make rename OS=somestring`.

== Prerequisites ==
 * GNU gcc and GNU g++
 * GNU make (make sure "gmake" links to GNU make on non-GNU platforms)
 * epkg from http://www.encap.org/epkg/
   * If built from source, first need all recommended libraries from web page

You will need binaries of the GNU tools. For GNU and BSD based operating 
systems, you should be able to get these via the operating system's package 
system. For commercial operating systems, these can be obtained from:

 AIX::
 * UCLA's Public Domain Software Library for AIX at 
   http://aixpdslib.seas.ucla.edu/aixpdslib.html 
   (These are trivial to convert into encap packages)
 * Bull AIX Freeware at http://www.bullfreeware.com/

 Solaris::
 * Freeware for Solaris at http://www.sunfreeware.com/
 * Community Software for Solaris at http://www.blastwave.org/packages.php

== Supported Platforms == 
Below is a table of platforms that have been successfully bootstrapped using
this code.

|| OS        || Vendor || Version || Arch  || GCC   || By || With VERSION   ||
|| AIX       || IBM    || 5.3     || POWER || 4.1.0 || dc || 0.1/0.8.2pre6  ||
|| GNU/Linux || Debian || Sarge   || i386  || 3.3.5 || dc || 0.1/0.8.2pre6  ||
|| GNU/Linux || Debian || Sid     || i386  || 4.1.2 || dc || 0.3/0.8.2pre10 ||

If you bootstrap a platform not listed above, please add a comment to:
 * http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/ticket/74
so that platform can be added to the list. 

If you modified any of the files in this package to be able to bootstrap the
new platform, please include either diffs or a tarball of your modified
version in a new ticket so your changes can be incorporated into a new
release. 

Any other notes, such as where you got the GNU binaries or any issues people
should be aware of, would also be appreciated. 

You may want to scan all of the bootstrapped binaries and libraries with
`ldd` (or equivalent) to make sure there are no dependencies on libraries
other than those included with the base operating system and the libraries
built as part of the bootstrap process. 

On non-GNU operating systems, libgcc and libstdc++ are a run-time
requirement. These libraries are usually distributed with gcc/g++, so the
bootstrap system attempts to create encap packages containing those
libraries by copying them from the build machine. To test that this worked,
you'll want to either temporarily remove gcc/g++ from the build machine and
make sure everything still works, or install the bcfg2-*.tar.gz encap
packages on a "clean" machine (without a gcc/g++ install) and test on that 
machine.

Note that the doc for the encap profile format is in "man 5 encap_profile".

== Release Notes ==
 0.1::
 * Initial Released Version
 * Work needs to be done to minimize size of distribution. In 0.1
   libraries and binaries are not stripped, and there is a lot of
   pruning that can be done of individual packages.

 0.2::
 * Updated bcfg2 to 0.8.2pre7
 * Updated README to point to mcs.anl.gov resources

 0.3::
 * Updated bcfg2 to 0.8.2pre10
