= EncapTodo: TODO =

== For 0.8.4  ==

 * Write HOWTO

 * Packages all deps of new reports (django etc.) for GNU/Linux

 * Move from lxml (+deps) to elementtree for client
   * Maybe just move to Python 2.5 (which includes elementtree) if final comes
     out on schedule (Sept 12th, 2006 is planned final release date)
 
== For 0.8.5 or earlier ==

 * Cut down distribution size to something more reasonable
   * Some platforms are now >150MB (installed)
   * Remove unneeded doc / test code / etc.
   * Perhaps make seperate -doc- or -extra- encap packages
   * Might be able to make client-side only python 2.5 (statically linked to
     deps like openssl), bcfg2, daemontools, ostiary, and bcfg2-site.
       * http://groups.google.com/groups/starred?lnk=lnmst&hl=en
   * Look into using http://sourceforge.net/projects/cx-freeze/ for client-side

== For 0.8.6 or earlier ==
 
 * Improve handling of libgcc/libstdc++

 * Try to make build not effect the build host as much
 
 * Try to make it possible to build as non-root

 * Handle removals nicely (preremove/postremove scripts)
   * Work towards full compliance with encap 2.1 spec
   * Remove /service links in remove scripts for daemontools services
