If you can't find an epkg binary compiled with all of the extra
libraries for your platform, you can use this Makefile (which will
probably require a little bit of editing for platforms other than
Solaris/x86 10) to compile it.

You'll need to manually download the versions of packages you want to
this directory, edit the Makefile to refer to those versions,
decompress/untar the distributions, and then run make (or gmake on
non-GNU platforms)

All of the software is available from:
 * http://mirror.opensysadmin.com/epkg-deps/epkg-with-all-deps.tar.gz
You will want to download and extract this file to this directory, as
it contains symbloic links to the README and Makefile in this directory.
After that is complete, do "cd epkg-with-all-deps" and then "make" or
"gmake" (depending on what GNU Make is called on your machine).

Once you have a working epkg distribution, you should:
 * cd /usr/local/encap
 * mkencap -c epkg-x.y.z
 * Rename the tar.gz file with the appropriate encap string
   (i.e. mv epkg-x.y.z.tar.gz epkg-x.y.z-encap-i386-solaris10.tar.gz)
 * Upload that file to the encap repository at:
   http://www.encap.org/search/upload.fcgi
 * Update the ticket at http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/ticket/74   
   with a quick note stating you've done the encap upload so it can be 
   mirrored at http://www.dclark.us/mirror/epkg-contrib
