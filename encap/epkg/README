If you can't find an epkg binary compiled with all of the extra
libraries for your platform, you can use this Makefile (which will
probably require a little bit of editing for platforms other than
Solaris/x86 10) to compile it.

You'll need to manually download the versions of packages you want to
this directory, edit the Makefile to refer to those versions,
decompress/untar the distributions, and then run make (or gmake on
non-GNU platforms)

All of the software is available from:
 * http://www.dclark.us/mirror/epkg-deps
(or Google for it).

Once you have a working epkg distribution, you should:
 * cd /usr/local/encap
 * mkencap -c epkg-x.y.z
 * Rename the tar.gz file with the appropriate encap string
   (i.e. mv epkg-x.y.z.tar.gz epkg-x.y.z-encap-i386-solaris10.tar.gz)
 * Upload that file to the encap repository at:
   http://www.encap.org/search/upload.fcgi
 * Update the ticket at http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/ticket/74   
   with a quick note stating you've done the encap upload so it can be 
   mirrored at http://www.dclark.us/mirror/epkg-contrib
