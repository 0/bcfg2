== Release Notes ==
 0.1::
 * Initial Released Version
 * Work needs to be done to minimize size of distribution. In 0.1
   libraries and binaries are not stripped, and there is a lot of
   pruning that can be done of individual packages.

 0.2::
 * Updated bcfg2 to 0.8.2pre7
 * Updated README to point to mcs.anl.gov resources

 0.3::
 * Updated bcfg2 to 0.8.2pre10

 0.4::
 * Versions before this version won't work without manually fixing paths
 * Added patches so paths actually exist, specifically:
   * bcfg2.conf default location is /usr/local/etc
   * epkg/encap paths changed to encap default /usr/local paths
   * schema prefix patch (changeset 1953) applied
   * default schema prefix changed to /usr/local/lib/bcfg2
 * Added mirror of all packages downloaded by the profiles at 
   http://www.pobox.com/users/dclark/mirror and made mirror default for
   those downloads
   * Set up automatic hourly mirror of bcfg2 ftp site *.tar.gz files
   * Mirror of other packages is manual (but deps shouldn't change often)

 0.5::
 * Removed external download of patches as that was not working consistently;
   replaced with patches inline the bcfg2 encap profile (.ep file)
 * Added GNU patch dependency, both for bcfg2 patches and call from Cfg.py
 * Fixed bcfg-repo-validate so it can find xmllint (as b2-xmllint)
 
 0.6::
 * Updated bcfg2 to 0.8.2 (released version)
 * Removed r1953 patch from bcfg2 profile, since that is included in 0.8.2
 * Added alpha version warning

 * Added Solaris support

 0.8::
 * Added python code to fix paths; removed inline patch & GNU patch dependency
