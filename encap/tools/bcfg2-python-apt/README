Before building this, make sure that you have these libraries installed:
 * /usr/lib/libapt-pkg* (Part of the "apt" package on Debian)
 * /usr/lib/libapt-inst* (Part of the "apt-utils" package on Debian)

You also must have the "libapt-pkg-dev" package installed.

To see if your Debian variant is supported, do "grep ifeq Makefile" and see if
any of those strings match "cat /etc/issue".

It should be pretty trivial to add new Debian platforms; if you have any
issues, mail the bcfg2-dev list or open a ticket.
