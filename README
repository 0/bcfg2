Bcfg2 is a configuration management system. It helps system administrators
deploy complex changes across large numbers of systems in a coherent and 
transparent fashion. 

Much documentation is available on the Bcfg2 web site, at:
http://www.bcfg2.org

For a basic installation of bcfg2, (ignoring prerequisites) can be performed 
by running the command:
$ python setup install --prefix=/install/prefix

This command will install all code and binaries in that prefix. If the installation
prefix is not /usr, or the python installation prefix, then the environment variable
PYTHONPATH will need to be adjusted to point at the bcfg2 libraries installed into:
$ PYTHONPATH=/install/prefix/lib/python2.X/site-packages
