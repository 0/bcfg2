Release 0.3 - $Id: $

This is the Bcfg2 repo. It is a configuration management system
designed to ease the management of networks of heterogenous
systems. The system has been completely redesigned and reimplemented
from version 1.

Currently, bcfg2 is in alpha-ish state. The server infrastructure can
produce configurations in clients based on the a set of structures and
generators. Generators can provide clients with probes to execute
(guiding the configuration generation process) and recieve the data
these probes generate. Client statistics are not currently generated. 

The bcfg2 client is a lot more rough. The client works, though its
adherence to bundle semantics is probably not what it should be. It
successfully one-way validates configurations. Two-way support is not
yet implemented. 

The source tree is structured in the following way:

doc/ - documentation
src/  - source code
schemas/ - schemas defining the data format for configuration files
